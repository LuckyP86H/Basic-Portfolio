      <p>Hello everyone! My name is Paul. Welcome to my home page. I am currently learing full stack development at University of Toronto SCS Coding Boot Camp. </p>

      <p>My interest is in the area of Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. One of the most unforgettable experience should belong to the undergraduate research assistant. My supervisor and I focused on the trusted model within the scope of artificial intelligence. Our goal is to implement a solution for Facebook about how to identify fake news.</p>

      <p>SBeyond those experiences and interest, I am passionate about volunteering, communicating and sporting. I served Canada Day for the past two years. One is for the logistics team and the other is for the executive team. Also, I participated in volunteer in Equithon for helping two teams solve different kinds of programming and data managing problems. As for improving my communication skills, I joined in the 2015 Fall Open House as a campus tour guide. Besides, I enjoy playing badminton, basketball and doing fitness in my spare time.</p>
      
      <p>If you have any question, don't hesitate to connect with me. I am happy to share!</p>
